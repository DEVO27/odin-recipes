        <h3>STEPS:</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook gnocchi according to package instructions; drain well.</li>
            <li>Season chicken with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown and <br> 
                cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4-5 minutes per side; set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Add shallot, and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, <br> 
                about 3-5 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in chicken broth and wine, and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, <br>
                about 3-5 minutes. Stir in half and half until thickened, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
            <li>Stir in gnocchi and kale until the kale has wilted, about 1-2 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet; sprinkle with Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Place into oven and bake until bubbly, about 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
