            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons black sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Bamboo sushi mat</li>
            <li>8 nori sheets</li>
            <li>1 small cucumber, seeded and julienned</li>
            <li>3 ounces imitation crabmeat sticks, julienned</li>
            <li>1 medium ripe avocado, peeled and julienned</li>
            <li><strong><em>Optional:</em></strong> Reduced-sodium soy sauce, prepared wasabi and pickled ginger slices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>In a large saucepan, combine rice and water; let stand for 30 minutes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; <br>
                cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until water is absorbed and rice is tender. Remove from the heat. <br>
                Let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine the vinegar, sugar and salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Transfer rice to a large shallow bowl; drizzle with vinegar mixture. With a wooden paddle or spoon, stir<br> 
                rice with a slicing motion to cool slightly. Cover with a damp cloth to keep moist. (Rice mixture may be made<br>
                up to 2 hours ahead and stored at room temperature, covered with a damp towel. Do not refrigerate.)</li>
            <li>Sprinkle toasted and black sesame seeds onto a plate; set aside. Place sushi mat on a work surface so mat <br>
                rolls away from you; line with plastic wrap. Place 3/4 cup rice on plastic. With moistened fingers, <br>
                press rice into an 8-in. square. Top with 1 nori sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange a small amount of cucumber, crab and avocado about 1-1/2 in. from bottom edge of nori sheet. <br>
                Roll up rice mixture over filling, using the bamboo mat to lift and compress the mixture while rolling; <br>
                remove plastic wrap as you roll. </li>
            <li>
                Remove mat; roll sushi rolls in sesame seeds. Cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining ingredients <br>
                to make 8 rolls. Cut each into 8 pieces. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi and ginger slices if desired. <br>
            </li>
        </ol>
